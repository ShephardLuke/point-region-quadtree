# Point Region Quadtree
### https://point-region-quadtree.shephardluke.co.uk
A showcase of a point region quadtree. Click in the canvas to add points, watch the quadtree split into sections so that each section contains exactly one point.

This is an abandoned project, intended to be a better version of my [automata tool](https://github.com/ShephardLuke/automata-tool-prototype) but I decided to do something else instead. This quadtree showcase however is a finished part from it worth showing.
